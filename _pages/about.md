I am a Research Scholar in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK), working under the guidance of Prof. Sandeep Kumar Shukla. My research primarily focuses on malware analysis and system security, with a particular emphasis on developing advanced techniques for the early detection of ransomware.
